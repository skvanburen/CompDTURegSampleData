# CompDTURegSampleData

This repo provides sample data quantified by Salmon that contains 100 bootstrap samples for each of 10 samples.  The data come from the Sequencing Quality Control Project (SEQC) from two reference RNA samples, “A” and “B”. Sample A contains five replicates of the Strategene Univer- sal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) and Sample B contains five replicates of the Ambion Human Brain Reference RNA (HBRR).  See SEQC/MAQC-III Consortium (2014), ``A comprehensive assessment of RNA-seq accuracy, reproducibility and information content by the Sequencing Quality Control Consortium,'' Nature Biotechnology, 32, 903 – 917. for more information.

This data is designed to be used with the CompDTUReg package available at https://github.com/skvanburen/CompDTUReg.
